# open-mapping
Repository to start a community work on mapping the Berlin landscape of Open Access, Open Research, Open Science

# Survey data file
The initial list of projects and initiatives was collected within the consultation Berlin Open Research 2020. The list contains free text field reponses to question 11: What initiatives / projects / collaborations (e.g. within the Berlin University Alliance) / etc. are located at your institution with regard to Open Research? The question had 48 responses in total, of which 36 were evaluated. We did not include comments such as "many". For 36 responses, missing project information was added and verified (e.g. URL).

Open-Access-Büro Berlin revised the survey data list and added further project information from the report "Arbeitsgruppe Open-Access-Strategie Berlin (forthcoming) Ergebnisse der Open-Access-Strategie für Berlin 2015--2020 / Empfehlung für eine Landesinitiative Open Research Berlin" (DOI will be added when the report is published).
