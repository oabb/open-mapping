# open-mapping
Repository to start a community work on mapping the Berlin landscape of Open Access, Open Research, Open Science

# Initial file documentation (version 1.0 dated from 16 March 2021)

This list of projects and initiatives was collected within the consultation Berlin Open Research 2020. The list contains free text field reponses to question 11: What initiatives / projects / collaborations (e.g. within the Berlin University Alliance) / etc. are located at your institution with regard to Open Research? The question had 48 responses in total, of which 36 were evaluated. We did not include comments such as "many". For 36 responses, missing project information was added and verified (e.g. URL) by Sophie Kobialka (student assistant at Open-Access-B端ro Berlin) in January 2020. 

# Adding further Berlin projects and initiatives

Open-Access-B端ro Berlin revised the list and added further project information from the report "Arbeitsgruppe Open-Access-Strategie Berlin (forthcoming) Ergebnisse der Open-Access-Strategie f端r Berlin 2015--2020 / Empfehlung f端r eine Landesinitiative Open Research Berlin" (DOI will be added when the report is published).

We would be hapypy if other colleagues like to add further Berlin Open Research projects and initiatives to the list.
